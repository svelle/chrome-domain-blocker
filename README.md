# Chrome Website Blocker Extension

This started as a little project to see how easy (or hard) it is to basically code a Chrome extension with help from ChatGPT and VSCode CoPilot.

I'd say at this point about 70% of the code is generated, which is also why this project doesn't have a license file attached to it.
The icons are also generated.

Feel free to use this as a base for whatever you want to do with it. Commercial use is **not allowed**.
